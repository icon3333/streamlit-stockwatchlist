# Stock Watchlist Tool üìà

> **Note**: This is a hobby project created with the assistance of LLMs (Large Language Models). All tools and code here are for experimental and learning purposes only, not intended for production use. Feel free to explore and play around!

A Streamlit-based application to maintain and analyze your stock watchlist with real-time data from Yahoo Finance.

## üëã About This Project

I'm a hobby programmer who enjoys experimenting with different tools and technologies. This project was created using:
- LLMs (like ChatGPT/Claude) for code assistance
- Streamlit for the web interface
- Python for data processing
- Docker for containerization

The goal is to learn and have fun while building something useful! While the code works, it's meant for personal use and experimentation rather than production environments.

## Features

- **Add Stocks:** Input ticker symbols to add stocks to your watchlist
- **View Watchlist:** Displays key metrics for each stock
- **Edit Themes:** Customize the 'theme' column to group stocks
- **Group Stocks:** Group stocks by any column, including numerical columns divided into quintiles
- **Automatic Data Refresh:** Data is refreshed every 24 hours to ensure up-to-date information
- **Bulk Import:** Add multiple stocks via CSV upload
- **Persistent Storage:** All your watchlist data is stored locally
